          <strong>Special accommodations:</strong> To obtain
          disability-related academic adjustments or accommodations,
          students with disabilities must contact their professor and
          <a href="http://disability.illinois.edu/">Disability
          Resources and Educational Services (DRES)</a> as soon as
          possible.

          <strong>iClickers:</strong> Short quizzes are conducted
          during lectures using iClickers. An iClicker can be
          purchased from the bookstore must be activated at the <a
          href="https://my.physics.illinois.edu/iclicker/">registration
          site</a>.

          <strong>Grading:</strong> The total score for the course is
          computed with the following weights:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr><td>Midterm 1 Exam</td><td>20%</td><td class="leftSpace">Written reports</td><td>5%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Midterm 2 Exam</td><td>20%</td><td class="leftSpace">Online homework</td><td>15%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Final Exam</td><td>30%</td><td class="leftSpace">Discussion worksheets</td><td>8%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>In-lecture iClickers</td><td>2%</td><td class="leftSpace"></td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          For written reports, online homework, and discussion
          worksheets, the lowest two scores from each assessment type
          will be dropped before the average score is computed. These
          dropped assessments are intended to cover illness and other
          unavoidable absences. See the Absences policy below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Final grades:</strong> The total score <i>s</i>
          corresponds to final grades as follows.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr><td>97% ≤ <i>s</i> &lt; 100%</td><td>A+</td><td class="leftSpace">93% ≤ <i>s</i> &lt; 97% </td><td>A</td><td class="leftSpace">90% ≤ <i>s</i> &lt; 93% </td><td>A-</td></tr>

        <p>
          <strong>Lectures:</strong> Prompt and regular attendance at
          lectures is required. You must attend the lecture section
          that you are officially enrolled in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Discussion sections:</strong> Prompt and regular
          attendance at your discussion section is required. You must
          attend only the discussion section in which you are
          enrolled. Most discussion sessions will consist of a
          group-work worksheet exercise. Students are randomly
          assigned each session to a group of three to five
          people. Each student must submit a completed worksheet, but
          only one randomly chosen worksheet will be scored from each
          group, and every student in that group will be given that
          score. If you are more than 5 minutes late to a discussion
          session then you will not be permitted to complete the
          worksheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Office hours:</strong> Daily office hours are held
          in Grainger 429 from 3-8pm on Sunday through Thursday each
          week, staffed by TAs and professors. You can come to the
          office hours at any time for help about anything related to
          the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Online homeworks:</strong> Weekly online homeworks
          are due Friday midnight, using the smartPhysics
          system. There will be 6 questions per week. Two of the
          questions will have a bonus 10% score if they are submitted
          by Monday. Another two questions will have a similar bonus
          if submitted by Wednesday. Late online homework will be
          accepted with a 50% penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Written reports:</strong> Each week a written report
          must be submitted, consisting of a full write-up of a
          specified online homework problem. This is submitted at the
          start of the weekly discussion session and will be graded by
          the TA and returned in the following week's discussion
          session. Written reports are designed to practice the
          communication of engineering concepts in writing. They will
          be graded based on presentation quality, neatness, correct
          use of symbols, clear drawings and diagrams, and clarity of
          explanation. Correctness of the answer will not be
          graded. Late written reports will not be accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exams:</strong> Exams are held as shown on the <a
          href="sched.xhtml">class schedule</a>. If you are unable to
          attend an exam then you must inform your professor by email
          at the earliest possible opportunity. For non-emergency
          absences this notification must be at least one week in
          advance.

          <strong>Participation Star Points:</strong> This course is
          under active development and mistakes will occur in online
          material and on assessments. For each error, the first
          student who posts a correct notification to Piazza will
          receive one Participation Star Point. At the end of semester
          each Star Point will give a bonus score equivalent to 10% of
          one homework question (up to a maximum of 5% extra total
          score). Star Points will also be awarded to students who
          provide good answers to questions on Piazza and for other
          meritorious service throughout the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gradebook:</strong> All assessment scores are stored
          in the <a
          href="https://my.mechse.illinois.edu/gradebook/">My.MechSE
          gradebook</a>. To have credit awarded, any errors or missing
          scores must be reported to your professor within 2 weeks of
          the due date of the assessment item or by the last day of
          class, whichever is earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contact and obtaining help:</strong> The two main
          ways to obtain help are online at Piazza, or in person at
          the Grainger office hours. You can also speak with your
          professor briefly after lecture. Please do not send email
          directly to TAs or professors for routine help or
          absences. In case of emergencies related to exams (e.g.,
          illness) then you should email your professor at the
          earliest possibly opportunity.

          <strong>Absences:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Excuses from assessments will only be given in the following circumstances:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Illness.</li>
              <li>Personal crisis (e.g., car accident, required court
              appearance, death of a close relative).</li>
              <li>Required attendance at an official UIUC activity
              (e.g., varsity athletics, band concert).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            In cases (a) or (b) an official excuse letter from the
            <a href="http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/deanonduty/">Dean on
            Duty</a> must be sent directly to your professor within
            two weeks of the due date of the missed assessment.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case (c) an official letter from the designated
            university official must be sent directly to your
            professor at least one week prior to the due date of the
            missed assessment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The dropped assessments are intended for excused
            absences. If there are more excused absences for a given
            assessment type than the standard number of dropped
            assessments for that type, then the number of dropped
            assessments of that type will be increased to be equal
            to the number of excused absences for that type. For
            example, if the two lowest homework scores are normally
            dropped, but you have four excused absences for
            homeworks, then the four lowest homework scores will be
            dropped.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you will not be able to sit an exam due to illness or
            any other reason, you must send email to your professor at
            the earliest possible opportunity. Excused exams will be
            replaced by a weighted average of the other exam scores at
            the end of semester.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notwithstanding the above, at your professor's discretion
            you may be required to make up any excused work or attend
            substitute instruction or assessment.
          </li>
        </ol>
