          Turning in a circle requires a vehicle to have a <a
          href="rvt.html#rvt.sc">centripetal acceleration</a> inwards
          on the turn, and so there must be some centripetal force
          that produces this acceleration. For a vehicle driving on
          flat ground, this force must be produced by a sideways
          friction force on the tires. This introduces two problems:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If the coefficient of friction is not high enough (say the
            road is wet or icy), then the friction force will be
            insufficient and the vehicle will slide off the road.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even if the friction force is high enough, because it acts
            at the bottom of the tires, it produces a net moment about
            the center of mass, which can cause the vehicle to roll
            over.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To avoid both of these problems, the road can be <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banked_turn">banked</a>
          inwards, so that the outer edge of the road is higher than
          the inner edge. This is called <em>superelevation</em> and
          means that some of the centripetal force can be provided by
          the normal force with the road, reducing the friction force
          and minimizing the risk of slip or roll.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure below shows a bus driving around a sharp corner
          at high speed on a heavily banked road. To understand the
          dynamics of this vehicle and the design tradeoffs for
          cornering on banked turns, we need a model. We will start
          below with a simple point mass model, which will be enough
          to understand friction and sliding, and then move on to a 2D
          rigid-body body to understand roll behavior.

          To understand the dynamics of <a href="#avb-fc">the bus
          above</a>, we first need a simple model of the geometry of
          the road. A satellite photo of the track is shown below. The
          bus was photographed while on the far-left-hand curve, which we
          can see is approximately a half-circle with radius about 50

            above was taken on the far-left-hand corner, which has a

          To make a simple model, let us consider a track with
          straight segments and half-circular ends, as shown below. If
          we <button class="anim-toggle:avb-fg-c">animate</button> the
          bus then we can see the <button
          class="option-toggle:avb-fg-c:vectors">vectors</button> for
          velocity, acceleration, and force as the bus drives around
          the track. We assume constant speed, so there is only an
          acceleration <a href="rvc.html#rvc-em">when the velocity
          changes direction</a> around the corners. This model assumes
          semi-circular track ends, but <a href="avt.html">this is
          not a good idea</a> in practice.

          The centripetal acceleration must be caused by an inwards

          magnitude and source of this force, we now consider a simple

        <h2>Point mass model</h2>
        <p>
          Consider the bus as a single point mass on the track while
          going around the corner. The diagram below shows the bus
          front-on, so the inside of the track is towards the left. We
          start by assuming there is no bank on the road and that the
          bus is stationary. The <button
          class="seq-toggle:avb-fp-c:fbd">free body diagram</button>
          shows that the gravity force \(W\) is balanced by the normal
          force \(N\) from the road. If we now increase the bank
          angle \(\theta\) below, then we see that a friction force
          \(F\) tangential to the road is needed to keep the bus from
          sliding. In practice, this force will be limited by \(F \le
          \mu N\), where \(\mu\) is the <a
          href="rff.html#rff.sc">coefficient of friction</a>. If we
          incline the track until it is nearly vertical, we see that
          there a huge friction force would be required but only a
          tiny normal force is available. As this would not be
          possible without gluing the tires to the road, this
          situation would result in the bus sliding downwards towards
          the center of the track.

        </p>
        <p>
          Now set the bank angle back to \(0^\circ\) and make sure the
          speed is zero and that the <button
          class="seq-toggle:avb-fp-c:fbd">free body diagram</button>
          is visible. Now increase the speed of the bus to produce a
          centripetal acceleration. <a
          href="rkn.html#rkn-en">Newton's law</a> implies that there
          must be a centripetal friction force producing this
          acceleration. As the speed increases, we will eventually
          reach a point when the friction force required is too large
          and the bus will slide outwards on the track.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid sliding outwards, we can increase the bank on the
          road. This increases the normal force and decreases the
          friction force, making it less likely that sliding will
          occur. For any given speed, there is some angle that exactly
          cancels the friction force, so that all the force is normal
          force. This is a very safe driving situation, as no sliding
          is possible, even in very slippery road conditions. On the
          <a href="#avb-fc">real track</a>, the bank angle increases
          as the bus drives higher. This allows the driver to select
          the correct incline angle to minimize sliding risk. We can
          also show the forces in <button
          class="option-toggle:avb-fp-c:components">components</button>
          or as total vectors as we change the bank angle and bus
          speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this simple point mass model allows us to understand
          how banking the road can help with the problem of sliding,
          it does not tell us anything about rolling of the vehicle,
          because point masses can't rotate. We thus need a rigid body
          model to investigate roll.

        <h2>2D Rigid body model</h2>
        <p>
          We now use a single rigid body model for the bus and we will
          do everything in 2D. Below we see a front-on diagram of the
          bus, with the inside of the track to the left. If we turn on
          the <button class="seq-toggle:avb-fr-c:fbd">free body
          diagram</button>, then we see that the weight of the bus is
          supported by two forces, one on each wheel. If we increase
          \(\theta\) then the weight is supported more by the
          down-slope wheel, and we also see sideways friction forces
          appear to stop the bus from sliding. If the slope becomes
          too steep, then the normal force on the up-slope wheel
          reverses direction, indicating that it is holding the wheel
          down onto the road. Physically this cannot happen, so at
          this point the bus would tip over. We needed this rigid-body
          model to understand this tipping behavior, as we couldn't
          model this with the <a href="#avb-sp">point mass
          model</a>. Depending on the value of the friction
          coefficient, the bus may either slide or roll first as
          \(\theta\) increases.

          Road bank angle: <input type="range" min="0" max="85" value="0" class="data-input:avb-fr-c:thetaDeg" />

        </p>
        <p>
          If we now set the bank angle \(\theta\) back to zero, we
          can start to increase the speed \(v\). Now we see that the
          wheel on the inside of the track takes less of the weight,
          and the friction forces now stop the bus from sliding
          outwards on the track. If the bus goes too fast then it will
          roll outwards on the track (assuming the friction
          coefficient is high enough that it didn't slide first).
        </p>
        <p>
          Having considered both a banked road with stationary bus,
          and a moving bus on a horizontal road, we can now combine
          them to see the advantage of having a banked road when the
          bus is cornering. Choose a bus velocity, and then change the
          bank angle \(\theta\), so that the friction force is reduced
          (helping to avoid sliding) and the normal forces on the
          wheels are more evenly balanced (helping to avoid
          rolling). For any given speed, we can choose a bank angle so
          that there is simultaneously no sideways friction force and
          also exactly balanced normal forces. This is the safest bank
          angle for this speed.

        <h2>Design of roads, tracks, and rail</h2>
        <p>
          A straight road generally has the center somewhat higher
          than the edges to allow water to run off. This is called <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_slope">cross
          slope</a> or camber. When it is desired to have a banked
          turn, then the outer edge of the road is raised to produce
          <em>superelevation</em>, with the outer edge rising above
          both the center and the inner edge. The bank angle is chosen
          based on the radius of curvature of the turn and the
          expected speed of cars going around the turn, while still
          allowing for the fact that cars might be moving slowly or
          even stopped. The angle should thus not be chosen to
          eliminate all friction forces when cars are traveling at
          maximum speed, as this would be dangerous if traffic had to
          stop on the road.

          <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velodrome">Velodromes</a>
          are arenas with tracks designed for high-speed bicycle
          races, as shown below, with speeds up to 85 km/h. The bank
          angle on velodrome tracks is chosen to minimize sideways
          forces on the bicycles when they are traveling at near
          maximum speeds, so the angle chosen depends on the radius of
          curvature of the track corners. For example, the Blaine
          velodrome track pictured below is 250 m long and has a
          43&#xb0; bank angle on the corners and 15&#xb0; banking on
          the straightaways.

          High-speed trains such as the French <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV">TGV</a> operate at
          speeds of over 300 km/h and have run at <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV_world_speed_record">up
          to 575 km/h</a>. To accommodate cornering at such speeds,
          track bends are constructed with a large radius of curvature
          (at least 7 km for new tracks) and a bank angle of up to
          about 7&#xb0; (180 mm maximum superelevation with <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gauge">Standard
          gauge</a> of 1435 mm). For railways, banking the track is
          know as <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_%28road/rail%29">cant</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An alternative approach for cornering with trains is to
          leave the track relatively flat and to <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilting_train">tilt the
          train</a> as it travels around a corner. This allows
          high-speed trains to operate on regular tracks, while
          maintaining safety and comfort for the passengers. For
          example, the <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Tilt_Train">Queensland
          Rail Tilt Train</a> operates at 180 km/h by tilting at up to
          5&#xb0; around corners. As we see from our <a
          href="#avb-sr">rigid body analysis</a> above, tilting the
          train will help with avoiding tipping over at high speeds,
          but will not help with reducing horizontal friction
          forces. Even with a tilting train, entering a curve at too
          high a speed will lead to <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns_Tilt_Train_derailment">disastrous
          results</a>.

            High-speed trains such as the <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV">French TGV</a> and
            <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity-Express">German
            ICE</a> require many sophisticated engineering techniques
            to enable travel at extreme speed. Very smooth rails are
            needed, so the track is formed by welding the segments
            together into one precisely-aligned continuous steel
            line. The steel rails conduct heat too well for
            conventional welding, so <a href="">thermite</a> welding
            is used to join the track segments.
          </p>
          <p>
            At high speeds the train drivers are unable to see railway
            signals on the side of the track. Electronic signaling
            systems are used to communicate to the drivers, either <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Voie-Machine">through
            the tracks</a> for the TGV or <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linienzugbeeinflussung">via
            additional cables</a> for the ICE.

            Friction-based brakes produce too much heat, as they would
            need to absorb the kinetic energy of several hundred
            tonnes of train moving at over 300 km/h. Instead, <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_braking">dynamic
            breaking</a> is used, in which the electric motors
            powering the trains are run in reverse as generators and
            the energy is shed as heat in resistor arrays. At
            extremely high speeds, the wheels themselves cannot
            provide sufficient traction to enable braking, so
            technologies like <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake">magnetic
            induction brakes</a> are being developed, which directly
            push against the rails without involving the wheels at
            all.
