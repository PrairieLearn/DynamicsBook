          What happens when we step on the gas or brake in a car? The
          car pushes against the road to either accelerate (gas pedal)
          or decelerate (brake pedal). But how are the forces on the
          car and wheels distributed? What determines whether the
          wheels grip the road or lose traction and spin or slide?

        <p>
          To study this problem we <a href="rom">need a
          model</a>. Let's start with the simplest model and then
          gradually consider more complex models.

        <h2>Point mass model</h2>
        <p>
          The simplest model of a car is to treat the entire vehicle
          as a point mass. On a <button
          class="seq-toggle:ava-fp-c:fbd">free body diagram</button>
          we have vertical force balance for a stationary car. When
          the car <button
          class="seq-step:ava-fp-c:motion:stationary">accelerates</button>,
          there is a horizontal forward force on the car, and a
          corresponding backwards horizontal force on the ground. As
          the car picks up speed, <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">air
          resistance</a> produces a backwards force. On the diagram we
          have drawn some forces offset from the center of mass, so
          that the vectors don't overlap. Because we are assuming a
          point mass model, however, all vectors are really acting at
          the same point.
        </p>
        <p>
          While cruising at a constant speed, there is a balance
          between the horizontal driving force and the drag force due
          to air resistance. When the car <button
          class="seq-step:ava-fp-c:motion:cruising">brakes</button>,
          there is a backwards force that slows the car down to a
          stop.

          We can think of the force vectors (such as the ground force
          on the car) as either in separate horizontal and vertical
          <button
          class="option-toggle:ava-fp-c:components">components</button>
          or as unified vectors. It may be helpful to pause the

          during <button

        <h2>2D rigid body model</h2>
        <p>
          Consider a car sitting stationary on the ground, as shown
          below. We will take the entire car plus wheels to be a
          single rigid body. Clearly this is inaccurate (the wheels
          can't turn), but it is <a href="roq.xhtml#roq.su">still
          useful</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start with the car stationary, sitting on the
          road. Gravity acts downward through the center of mass,
          while there are upwards reaction forces on the wheels and
          corresponding equal and opposite forces downwards on the
          ground. Because the car is not accelerating, the total
          forces on the car are in balance, as we can see on the
          <button class="seq-toggle:ava-fr-c:fbd">free body
          diagram</button>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the driver <button
          class="seq-step:ava-fr-c:motion:stationary">presses down on the gas
          pedal</button>, this results in the car pushing back on the
          road, giving a net forward force on the driving wheels (the
          back wheels for our car), and the car accelerates up to
          cruising speed. Here we are including <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">air
          resistance</a> but neglecting <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance">rolling
          resistance</a>, and while cruising at constant speed the
          driving force exactly balances the drag force from air
          resistance. When the driver <button
          class="seq-step:ava-fr-c:motion:cruising">presses down on the
          brake pedal</button>, the car pushes on the road to slow
          down, giving backward forces on both wheels and causing the
          car to decelerate to a stop.

          class="seq-step:ava-fr-c:motion:cruising">braking</button>
          cycle a few times while showing the <button
          class="seq-toggle:ava-fr-c:fbd">free body
          diagram</button>. Observe the horizontal and vertical forces
          of the road on the car wheels. Also view the forces both in
          <button class="option-toggle:ava-fr-c:components">vector
          components</button> and as total force vectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vertical forces of the road on the car always need to
          balance the gravitational force, but we can see that the
          distribution between front and rear wheels changes as the
          car accelerates and decelerates. This is because the
          horizontal driving and braking forces are below the center
          of mass and produce a moment. The vehicle is not rotating,
          so this moment must be counteracted by the ground
          forces. The force directions mean that the rear wheels take
          more weight during acceleration, while the front wheels take
          more weight during braking.

        <h2>Traction, acceleration, and braking</h2>
        <p>
          The maximum force with which the car can push against the
          road is limited by the <a href="rff.xhtml">friction
          coefficient</a> of the tire multiplied by the normal
          force. This applies both during acceleration and braking.
        </p>
        <p>
          To accelerate as hard as possible, we should thus use a <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_layout#Rear-wheel-drive_layouts">rear-wheel
          drive</a> layout. If we accelerate too hard, however, then
          the back wheels will slip and experience <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelspin">wheelspin</a>,
          because the <a href="rff.xhtml">dynamic coefficient of
          friction</a> is lower than the static coefficient.  While
          high-performance applications generally want to maintain
          traction in all cases, the impressive effects of traction
          loss are sometimes deliberately produced. Spinning the rear
          wheels in a <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_(vehicle)">burnout</a>
          produces smoke as the tires vaporize due to the heat from
          friction. <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_racing">Drag
          racers</a> perform a burnout at the start of a race to clean
          the tires and heat them to an optimal temperature. To easily
          produce a burnout a <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_lock">line lock</a>
          can be installed to enable the brakes to be applied only to
          the front wheels (although this is often illegal on street
          cars). Alternatively, a burnout <a
          href="http://youtu.be/rSwOTV-jbns">can be performed</a> by
          disengaging the clutch, running the engine at a high revs,
          and then rapidly engaging the clutch. The high <a
          href="rkm">angular momentum</a> of the engine then provides
          a <a href="rkm">rotational impulse</a> to the rear wheels,
          causing them to lose traction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if traction is maintained during acceleration, a second
          problem that may occur is that the torque from the rear
          wheels can be enough to lift the front wheels off the
          ground, so that the vehicle performs a <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelie">wheelie</a>. This
          occurs very easily for motorbikes and BMX bicycles, due to a
          high center of mass to wheelbase ratio, but <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pro_Street_Camaro_at_launch.JPG">can
          also occur for cars</a> with poor geometry and sufficient
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problems of wheel slip and wheel lift-off occur in
          reverse while braking. Any car with well-maintained brakes
          has sufficient braking power to cause the wheels to lock,
          even in dry conditions with good traction. For this reason
          many cars now include <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-lock_braking_system">anti-lock
          braking systems (ABS)</a>, which detect wheel locking and
          rapidly pulse the brake force to prevent locking. Even
          better than this are <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_brakeforce_distribution">electronic
          brakeforce distribution (EBD)</a> systems, which apply the
          maximal brake force to each wheel while maintaining traction
          and control, better than any unassisted human driver could
          achieve. Due to the weight transfer to the front wheels
          during braking, the front brakes generally apply much
          greater force and thus wear out sooner than the rear brakes.

        <h2>2D multi-body model</h2>
        <p>
          To understand how forces and moments act on the wheels, we
          need to separate out the <a href="#ava-sr">single rigid-body
          model</a> into multiple rigid bodies. The simplest version
          of this has one rigid body for the body, and four rigid
          bodies for the wheels. We will assume that the two front
          wheels always act as a pair (same forces, same motion), and
          similarly for the two back wheels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again we start with the car stationary, and on the <button
          class="seq-toggle:ava-fm-c:fbd">free body diagram</button>
          we see the balance of vertical forces. Remember that the
          force shown on each wheel is really doubled, as there are
          two front and two rear wheels.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we now <button
          class="seq-step:ava-fm-c:motion:stationary">accelerate</button>,
          then we see a clockwise moment applied to the rear (driving)
          wheels. This causes the wheel to rotate, but friction forces
          means that it must <a href="rkl.xhtml">roll without
          slipping</a>, so there must be a forward contact force
          causing it to accelerate forwards. Counteracting this is a
          backwards reaction force from the car on the wheel. On the
          car we see that there are equal and opposite forces and
          moments at the axles. Just as in the <a
          href="#ava-sr">single rigid body</a> case, we have a net
          horizontal force causing forward acceleration, and moment
          balance means that the weight of the car is transferred
          primarily to the rear wheels.

          applies backwards moments to both wheels, causing them to
          slow down. To maintain non-slip, there is a backwards force
          from the ground at the point of contact. Because the wheel
          is slowing down, the car pushes forward on the axle. The
          ground/axle forces are trying to rotate the wheel forward,
          which must be counteracted by the braking moment. The
          braking moment is thus counteracting both the rotational
          inertia of the wheel, as well as the force couple from the
          ground/axle forces. Of these, the force couple is much
          larger (stopping a wheel without the car attached would be
          comparatively easy for the brakes). During braking we see
          again the weight being transferred to the front wheels.

        <h2>More complex models</h2>
        <p>
          While we can learn a lot about car performance from the
          simple <a href="#ava-sr">rigid body</a> and <a
          href="#ava-sm">multi-body</a> models, there is a great deal
          of physics neglected by these models, which can be important
          for engineering design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the car and the tires are deformable bodies. The
          deformation of the tire is responsible for the <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_patch">contact
          patch</a> which generates the friction forces that allow a
          car to accelerate and brake. The physics of the frictional
          contact between the tire and ground can be very complex, as
          can the geometry of the tire. Modern <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire">tires</a> have
          complex <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tread">tread</a> patterns
          with grooves and lugs that are designed to channel away
          water and snow, maintaining traction even in challenging
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as being individually deformable, the wheels are are
          not rigidly connected to the car body <a href="#ava-sr">as
          above</a>, but they are actually connected by a <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)">suspension
          system</a>, consisting of <a href="aml.xhtml">linkages</a>,
          <a href="rff.xhtml">springs</a>, and <a
          href="rff.xhtml">shock absorbers</a>. These enable both a
          comfortable ride and safe handling of the vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The simple models above included a simple model of <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">air
          resistance</a>, but they neglected <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance">rolling
          resistance</a>. This is the force primarily produced by the
          tire being compressed and re-expanded at the contact with
          the ground as it rolls, producing a backward force on the
          wheel. Using steel wheels on steel can result in trains
          having up to <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance#Rolling_resistance_coefficient_examples">ten
          times lower</a> coefficients of rolling resistance than car
          tires, which is one reason for the efficiency of rail
          transport.

            <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000328223">There is
            evidence</a> that the wrinkling of fingers in
            water may serve the same purpose as tread patters on
            tires, improving traction in wet conditions by forming
            channels to carry away water. This hypothesis is supported
            by the fact that <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle#Water-immersion_wrinkling">finger

        <h2>Brake system design</h2>
        <p>
          The above model shows equal brake force applied on the front
          and rear wheels. This both inefficient and dangerous, as the
          rear wheels will lock while the front wheels are still
          turning. See #avs for steering and sliding. We want to apply
          more force on the front brakes, so that we can deliver the
          most total force while still having no sliding. This can be
          achieved by <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_brakeforce_distribution">electronic
          brakeforce distribution (EBD)</a> systems, however
          traditional systems are also possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basic outline of a brake system is that the brake pedal
          pushes on a <em>master cylinder</em>, which compresses
          hydraulic <em>brake fluid</em> in the <em>brake
          lines</em>. This then pushes on <em>slave cylinders</em> in
          each wheel, which push the <em>brake pads</em> onto the
          <em>brake rotors</em> (for disc brakes; drum brakes are
          somewhat different). The combination of slave cylinders and
          brake pads and their housing is called a <em>brake
          caliper</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To apply more force to the front brakes, one simple system
          used in practice is to have the front-wheel slave cylinders
          have a larger diameter than those on the rear
          wheels. Because the pressure in the brake lines is the same
          everywhere, the force exerted by the pistons is proportional
          to their cross-sectional area, resulting in more force with
          the larger-diameter front-wheel cylinders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern cars use more advanced systems. The master cylinder
          typically contains two pistons in a parallel arrangement, so
          that it can apply pressure to the front or rear brake lines
          even if the other brake line develops a leak. A <em>metering
          valve</em> applies pressure to the rear brakes before the
          front, improving vehicle steering stability and allowing
          mixed drum/disc systems to be used. A <em>pressure
          differential valve</em> detects brake hydraulic leaks by
          sensing different front/rear line pressures. A
          <em>proportioning valve</em> assists with applying a
          different pressure distribution to the rear brakes.
