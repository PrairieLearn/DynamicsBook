        <h1>Track transition curves</h1>
        <p>
          For passengers in a car or train, traveling in a straight
          line at constant speed is the most comfortable motion, as
          there is no acceleration. Roads or rail lines with only
          straight lines are rather limiting, however, so we
          frequently encounter curves, in the most extreme form in
          large freeway interchanges such as <a href="#avt-ff">shown
          below</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When designing a freeway interchange, one of the most basic
          questions just what shape the <em>transition curves</em>
          between the straight-line roads should have. Other
          considerations then follow, such as stacking the roads above
          each other and <a href="avb.xhtml">banking</a> the angle of
          the roads.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficultly in designing curves in roads arises from the
          need to have a smooth ride for the passengers in the
          vehicles as they traverse the curves at high speed. In
          particular, we do not want to have sudden changes in
          acceleration for the passengers.

        <h2>Circular arcs for transition curves</h2>
        <p>
          To understand the issues with transition curve design, we
          will consider a simple oval track with two straight segments
          joined by curves at both ends. The simplest curve shapes are
          semi-circles (half-circles), as <a href="#avt-fc">shown
          below</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="figureContainer width600" id="avt-fc">

          <p class="figureCaption">
            Car driving at constant speed around a track with straight line
            segments joined to perfect semi-circle ends. The graph at
            the bottom shows the acceleration magnitude versus
            time. Note the sudden jump in acceleration magnitude when
            the car switches from a straight line to the curve.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          If we <button class="anim-toggle:avt-fc-c">animate</button>
          the car driving around the track with semi-circle ends, then
          we see that there is zero acceleration on the straight
          segments, but on the semi-circular transition curves the
          acceleration is inwards with magnitude $v^2 / \rho$, where
          $\rho$ is the radius of curvature. A passenger would thus
          feel no acceleration on the straight segments, but then
          would suddenly feel a large sideways acceleration as the
          vehicle switches to the semi-circles, which would be very
          uncomfortable and potentially dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          For passenger comfort, we do not want rapid changes in
          acceleration for transition curves. That is, we want a low
          value for the derivative of acceleration with respect to
          time. The derivative of acceleration is known as
          <em>jerk</em>, defined by $\vec{\jmath} = \dot{\vec{a}}$
          (for vectors) or $j = \dot{a}$ (for scalars). With perfect
          semi-circular ends we see that the jerk is mathematically
          infinite at the transition to the curve, although in reality
          it would just be a very high value as the vehicle would not
          transition to the semi-circle instantaneously.

            While the terms <em>velocity</em> and
            <em>acceleration</em> are standard for the 1st and 2nd
            derivatives of position, the names for higher derivatives
            are not so well-established. While <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)">jerk</a>
            is often used for the derivative of acceleration (so the
            3rd derivative of position), the terms <em>jolt</em>,
            <em>surge</em>, and <em>lurch</em> are also sometimes
            encountered for this quantity. The derivative of jerk is
            sometimes called <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jounce">jounce</a> (so
            it is the 4th derivative of position). <a
            href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/21/11/006">Another
            suggestion</a> is to refer to the 4th, 5th, and 6th
            derivatives of position as <em>snap</em>,
            <em>crackle</em>, and <em>pop</em>, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing accelerations (causing jerk) must result from
            changing forces, due to Newton's second law. Although the
            terminology is also somewhat loose in this case, the
            derivative of force with respect to time is often referred
            to as <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yank_(physics)">yank</a>,
            and the derivative of yank is called <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tug_(physics)">tug</a>
            (the second derivative of force). Third derivatives and
            higher of force are very rarely encountered, and do not
            seem to have any names in common usage.

        <h2>Smooth transition curves with Euler spirals</h2>

          Unlike the sudden switch <a href="#rvt-fc">shown above</a>
          from a straight line segment (no curvature) to a curved
          transition curve, we would prefer to have a more gradual

          use <em>Euler spiral</em> segments, which start curving
          gradually and then increase the curvature the further the
          vehicle moves around the curve, before reversing the process
          on the second half of the curve. Euler spirals are one of
          the common types of <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_transition_curve">track
          transition curves</a> and are special because the curvature

          to a maximum value, before decreasing again to zero.  The

            The equation for a spiral with linear curvature variation
            was first derived by the Swiss mathematician <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonard
            Euler</a> in 1744, hence the name <em>Euler spiral</em>
            for this curve. The spiral was then independently
            rediscovered in the late 1800s by civil engineers who were
            unaware of Euler's work and who named the resulting spiral
            the <em>clothoid</em>, which is still a commonly used name
            in traffic engineering. This spiral also arises in the
            study of near-field diffraction in optics, as developed by
            the French engineer <a

        <h2>Euler spiral equation</h2>
        <p>
          An <em>Euler spiral</em> is a curve for which the
          acceleration magnitude increases at a constant rate as we
          travel along the curve at uniform velocity. Another way to
          say this is that the curvature is a linear function of the
          distance along the curve. To see that this is the same
          thing, we write the acceleration in a <a
          href="rvt.xhtml">tangential/normal basis</a> as \[ \vec{a} =
          \ddot{s} \, \hat{e}_t + \kappa v^2 \, \hat{e}_n. \] For
          constant-speed motion with speed $v$, the distance along the
          curve satisfies $\dot{s} = v = \text{constant}$, so
          $\ddot{s} = 0$. The acceleration vector thus only has a
          normal component, and this has magnitude proportional to the
          curvature $\kappa = 1/\rho$, where $\rho$ is the radius of
          curvature. To have the acceleration increasing linearly
          along the curve, we thus want the curvature to be a linear
          function of distance, so $\kappa = \alpha s$ for some
          constant $\alpha$.
        </p>
        <p>
          While specifying that $\kappa = \alpha s$ is enough to
          define the shape of the Euler spiral curve, finding the
          explicit equation for the curve is not so easy. We first
          introduce the functions $C(z)$ and $S(z)$, known as <em>Fresnel
          integrals</em> and defined by:
        </p>
        <div class="envContainer equation" id="avt-ef">
          <p class="envHeader">Fresnel integrals</p>
          <div class="envBody">
            <p>
              \[\begin{aligned}
              C(z) &amp;= \int_0^z \cos\Big(\frac{1}{2} \pi u^2\Big) du \\
              S(z) &amp;= \int_0^z \sin\Big(\frac{1}{2} \pi u^2\Big) du
              \end{aligned}\]
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Fresnel integrals do not have any simpler forms in terms
          of elementary functions, as the integrals in them cannot be
          computed in closed form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we define the constant $\ell = \sqrt{\pi/\alpha}$, and
          then the position at distance $s$ along an Euler spiral
          curve is:

              We start the spiral curve from the origin, initially
              moving horizontally to the right and curving upwards
              with constant speed $v$. Using a tangential/normal
              basis, let $\theta$ be the angle of $\hat{e}_t$ as
              shown. Then $\dot{\theta}$ can be found by considering
              two expressions for the acceleration. First, from the <a
              href="rvt.xhtml#rvt-ep">tangential/normal acceleration
              formula</a> we have \[ \vec{a} = \ddot{s} \, \hat{e}_t +
              \kappa v^2 \, \hat{e}_n = \alpha s v^2 \, \hat{e}_n, \]
              where we used the fact that $\ddot{s} = \dot{v} = 0$
              (constant speed) and that $\kappa = \alpha s$ for some
              constant $\alpha$ (the definition of the Euler spiral is
              that curvature is a linear function of distance $s$).
            </p>
            <p>
              The second expression for acceleration uses the angular
              velocity $\vec{\omega} = \dot\theta \, \hat{k}$ of the
              tangential/normal basis vectors. Recalling that $\vec{v}
              = v \, \hat{e}_t$ and $v$ is constant, we have
              \[\begin{aligned}
              \vec{a} = \dot{\vec{v}} = v \, \dot{\hat{e}}_t
              = v \, \vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_t
              = v \dot{\theta} \, \hat{e}_n. \end{aligned}\]
            </p>
            <p>
              Comparing the two expressions for $\vec{a}$ and using $s = vt$ we see that
              \[ \dot{\theta} = \alpha s v = \alpha v^2 t \] and we can
              integrate this (with the initial condition that $\theta$
              starts at zero) to give \[ \theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha
              v^2 t^2. \]
            </p>
            <p>
              To find the equation for $\vec{r}$ we can integrate the
              equation \[ \dot{\vec{r}} = v \, \hat{e}_t = v
              \cos\theta \, \hat{\imath} + v \sin\theta \,
              \hat{\jmath} \] starting from $\vec{r} = 0$ to obtain \[
              \begin{aligned} \vec{r} &amp;= \int_0^t \left(v
              \cos\Big(\frac{1}{2} \alpha v^2 \tau^2\Big) \,
              \hat{\imath} + v \sin\Big(\frac{1}{2} \alpha v^2 \tau^2

          Plotting the Euler spiral equation gives the curve below,
          which starts out at the origin with zero curvature, and the
          then has steadily increasing curvature as we move along it.

            Euler spiral shape defined by the <a
            href="#avt-ee">equation above</a>. Changing the value of
            $\alpha$ or $\ell$ simply scales the whole curve to make
            it bigger or smaller, without changing the shape.

          The full Euler spiral is unsuitable for track transitions,
          as the curvature increases without limit. Instead, we can
          piece together short segments of the Euler spiral to form
          our transition curve. For example, the right-hand curve in
          the <a href="#rvt-fe">smooth track above</a> is composed of
          two copies of the first quarter-turn of the Euler spiral,
          with one copy flipped upside down. This means the curvature
          starts at zero, increases linearly to a maximum halfway
          around the curve, then decreases linearly again back to zero
          to join the straight segment.

            The Fresnel integrals $C(x)$ and $S(x)$ are examples of <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_function">special
            functions</a>. The term <em>special function</em> does not
            have a precise mathematical definition. Instead, these are
            functions which arise frequently in applications and which
            have been extensively analyzed and documented. The classic
            reference for many special functions is the book known
            generally as <em>Abramowitz and Stegun</em>. This refers
            to the publication:
          </p>
          <p>
            Abramowitz, Milton and Stegun, Irene A. (editors)
            <em>Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas,
            Graphs, and Mathematical Tables</em>, Dover Publications,
            New York, 1972, ISBN 978-0-486-6.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the tables of special function values in Abramowitz
            and Stegun are no longer generally needed due to the
            advent of computers, there is still much useful
            information in the book. This useful information is now
            also available in the online successor <a
            href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/">Digital Library of
            Mathematical Functions</a> (DLMF) from the <a
            href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of
            Standards and Technology</a> (NIST). For example, <a
            href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/7">Chapter 7</a> of the DLMF
            includes the <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/7.2.iii">the
            definition of the Fresnel integrals</a> as well as <a
            href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/7.3.F3">plots</a> of the
            functions and <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/7.6.i">series
            expansions</a> for them.
