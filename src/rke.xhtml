          Question: You walking from one end of an airport to the
          other, with several moving walkways that you will use. You
          want to stop for a brief time to get your phone out of your
          bag.  To minimize your total walking time, should you stop
          when on a moving walkway or when stationary, or doesn't it
          matter?
        </p>

          Question: You are riding your bike from home to the store
          and back, and there is a constant wind blowing, so that on
          the way there you have a headwind, but on the way back you
          have a corresponding tailwind. Assume that the wind adds a
          constant offset to your speed. Are you slower, faster, or
          the same compared to if there was no wind at all?
        </p>
        <p>
          Question: What if the wind doubles your speed when it is a
          tailwind, but halves it when it's a headwind. Are you faster
          or slower or the same?
        </p>

          Question: Two runners are competing in a (slightly short) 40
          km long marathon. Fred runs the first 20 km at 20 km/h and
          the second 20 km at 10 km/h. Bill runs for exactly half his
          total time at 20 km/h and for the second half of his total
          time at 10 km/h. Who wins? Who has an average speed of 15
          km/h?
